# Regex Tutorial
A Regex is shorthand for regular expressions.
A Regex is a string of text that lets you create patterns that help match,locate,and manage text.
These expressions are extremely useful for extracting data like phone numbers,emails, that follow a specific pattern from text. They can also be used in conjunction with any programming language including JavaScript.


## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.Here is a basic template that you can use to create your own cheatsheet:

## Basic Syntax

 A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Some common special characters include:

'.' (dot): matches any single character except a newline

'*' (asterisk): matches the preceding character zero or more times

'+' (plus): matches the preceding character one or more times

'?' (question mark): matches the preceding character zero or one time

'^' (caret): matches the beginning of a string

'$' (dollar sign): matches the end of a string

### Anchors
'\b '- Matches the boundary between a word and a non-word character.

''\B' - Matches the boundary between two word characters or two non-word characters.

'^' - Matches the start of the string.

'$' - Matches the end of the string.


### Quantifiers
'* '- Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
'+ '- Matches one or more occurrences of the previous character or group.
'? '- Matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character or group.
'{m}' - Matches exactly m occurrences of the previous character or group.
'{m,n}' - Matches between m and n occurrences of the previous character or group.
